# Prism-Simulation

This project is a JavaScript application that allows users to interact with shapes and rays on a canvas.

## Features

- Drag and drop shapes and rays on the canvas.
- Shapes include triangles, rectangles, circles, and lines.
- Rays can be added and their paths calculated based on the shapes on the canvas.

## Files

- `dragging.js`: Contains the main logic for the canvas state, including adding shapes and rays, handling mouse events, and drawing on the canvas.
- `utils.js`: Contains utility functions for color conversion and point rotation.
- `Ray.js`: Contains the Ray class, which represents a ray on the canvas.
- All the other files are defenitions for the shapes that can be added to the canvas.

## Usage
